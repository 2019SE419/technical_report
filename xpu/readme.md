1. **Graphics Processing Unit**:

	<div align="center">

	</div>
	<br>

	A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 
	GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. 
	Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. 
	Their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. 
	In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. 
	In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.

	The term "GPU" was coined by Sony in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994.
	The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as "the world's first GPU".
	It was presented as a "single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines".
	Rival ATI Technologies coined the term "visual processing unit" or VPU with the release of the Radeon 9700 in 2002.

	Using a variety of structural techniques to achieve paralleling at the level of
	task, thread, data and instruction.
	With craft of TSMC 28nm HPC+, power consumption about 2.5W.

## H

	![hpu](./hpu.jpg)

	Developed by **Microsoft** for its own applications of Hololens.
	The first generation uses the craft of 29nm HPC and customized extension with 24 Tensilica DSP.
	The HPU supports 5-way cameras, a 1-way depth sensor (Depth sensor) and a 1-way motion sensor (Motion Sensor).

## I

1. **Intelligence Processing Unit**:
	
	There are two companies declaring the name IPU:

	- [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/)

	![graphcore](./graphcore.jpg)

	The IPU from Graphcore is aimed for graph computing.
	Graphcore believes that Graph is a very natural representation of knowledge models and corresponding algorithms, 
	so Graph is the basic representation of machine intelligence, applicable to both neural networks, 
	Bayesian networks and Markov fields, and possible future new models and algorithms.

	- [Mythic](https://www.mythic-ai.com/)

	> Mythic's intelligence processing unit (IPU) adds best-in-class intelligence to any device.

	Mythic claims to reduce power consumption to 1/50. The reason why they are so confident is because they use the "processing in memory" structure.

	![PIM chip](./pim.png)

	At each clock cycle, the pipelined ALU can either load data from memory or store data to memory, but not both
	at the same time. Also, on each clock cycle, the MU produces three outputs that can be either selected for storage
	(under mask control) or selected for recirculation.
	Additionally, data can be sent to other processors via the routing network.
	The processor can input data through a multiplexer
	(MUX) from either the parallel prefix network, the global
	OR network, the partitioned OR network, or the internal
	mask/register control.

2. **Image Processing Unit**:

	<br>

	Some static image processing modules of SOC chips are called IPUs,
	also ISPs(Image Signal Processor),
	which are used to process the output signals of camera devices
	such as cameras, and implements functions such as noise reduction, demosaicing, HDR, and color management.

## K

1. **Knowledge Processing Unit**:

	Declared by [Canaan](https://canaan.io/) for its AI chip in 2017,
	which integrating artificial neural network and high performance processor in single chip
	to provide heterogeneous, real-time, offline artificial intelligence application services.

## M

1. **Micro Processing Unit**:

	![MPU](https://en.wikichip.org/w/images/5/53/IPO_%28input-process-output%29.svg)

	A microprocessor (ÂµP) or a Microprocessing Unit (MPU) is a device that implements the core elements of a computer system on a single integrated circuit, or as a few integrated circuits operating as a cohesive unit, designed for the processing digital data.

	Modern microprocessors typically incorporate the functionality of a clock, central processing unit (CPU), arithmetic logic unit (ALU), floating point unit (FPU), control unit (CU), memory management unit (MMU), interrupts, input/output interfaces, and cache. Specialized microprocessor may also serve as graphical processing units (GPUs), signal processing units (DSPs), neural processing unit (NPUs), microcontrollers, etc.

2. **Mind Processing Unit**:
	
	An eternal tale.

3. **Memory Protection Unit**:

	![mem-protection](https://community.arm.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-37-85/582Untitled.png)

	The Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is a programmable unit that allows privileged software, typically an
	OS kernel, to define memory access permission. It monitors transactions, including instruction fetches
	and data accesses from the processor, which can trigger a fault exception when an access violation is
	detected.
