	</div>
	<br>

	A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 
	GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. 
	Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. 
	Their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. 
	In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. 
	In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.

	The term "GPU" was coined by Sony in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994.
	The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as "the world's first GPU".
	It was presented as a "single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines".
	Rival ATI Technologies coined the term "visual processing unit" or VPU with the release of the Radeon 9700 in 2002.

	There are two companies declaring the name IPU:

	- [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/)

	![graphcore](./graphcore.jpg)

	The IPU from Graphcore is aimed for graph computing.
	Graphcore believes that Graph is a very natural representation of knowledge models and corresponding algorithms, 
	so Graph is the basic representation of machine intelligence, applicable to both neural networks, 
	Bayesian networks and Markov fields, and possible future new models and algorithms.

	- [Mythic](https://www.mythic-ai.com/)

	> Mythic's intelligence processing unit (IPU) adds best-in-class intelligence to any device.

	Mythic claims to reduce power consumption to 1/50. The reason why they are so confident is because they use the "processing in memory" structure.

	![PIM chip](./pim.png)

	At each clock cycle, the pipelined ALU can either load data from memory or store data to memory, but not both
	at the same time. Also, on each clock cycle, the MU produces three outputs that can be either selected for storage
	(under mask control) or selected for recirculation.
	Additionally, data can be sent to other processors via the routing network.
	The processor can input data through a multiplexer
	(MUX) from either the parallel prefix network, the global
	OR network, the partitioned OR network, or the internal
	mask/register control.

	Quantum computing is the study of a still-hypothetical model of computation. Whereas traditional models of computing such as the Turing machine or Lambda calculus rely on "classical" representations of computational memory, a quantum computation could transform the memory into a quantum superposition of possible classical states. A quantum computer is a device that could perform such computation.
	A quantum processing unit (QPU), also referred to as a quantum chip, is a physical (fabricated) chip that contains a number of interconnected qubits. It is the foundational component of a full quantum computer, which includes the housing environment for the QPU, the control electronics, and many other components.

	Ray tracing is a rendering algorithm in computer graphics. RPU is an accelerator developed to accelerate the calculation of data in it. Now these calculations are all GPU things.

## S

1. **Streaming Processing Unit**:
	
	Stream processing is a computer programming paradigm, equivalent to dataflow programming, event stream processing, and reactive programming,
	that allows some applications to more easily exploit a limited form of parallel processing. Such applications can use multiple computational units, such as the floating point unit on a graphics processing unit or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs),
	without explicitly managing allocation, synchronization, or communication among those units.
	The SPU first appeared in the structure of the graphics chip. It can be said that the GPU is a stream processor. Even, there was a company named "Streaming Processor Inc", which was founded in 2004. In 2009, SPI was closed as the founder and chairman was dug up to NVIDIA as the chief scientist.

	![tpu](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/6VURbzBFQj4pYcVrBja4QKPcAb1m8uxNqwuMECnx8wdCib1XMRHTIoAYaphyI3pzhbWSWqR2juLEUGHCvputsOw/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)

	Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASICâcalled a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)âdeployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPUâs deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, â¦) that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacentersâ NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPUâs GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU. 

## V


1. **Vision Processing Unit**:

	![vpu](https://cdn-www.mediatek.com/posts/vpu.jpg)

	A vision processing unit (VPU) is a type of microprocessor aimed at accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. It is a specialized processor that is made to support tasks like image processing, one of several specialized chips such as the GPU that are generally useful in machine learning.
	The vision processing unit is in some ways similar to a video processing unit which is used with convolutional neural networks. Where a video processing unit is a specific type of graphics processing, the vision processing unit is described as more suitable for running different types of machine vision algorithms â these tools may be built with specific resources for getting visual data from cameras â they are built for parallel processing. Like video processing units, they are particularly geared toward image processing. Some of these tools are described as âlow power and high performanceâ and may be plugged into interfaces that allow for programmable use. Other aspects of the build can vary due to manufacturer and design choices.

2. **Vector Processing Unit**:

	![vectorpu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Petr_Honzik3/publication/239763131/figure/fig2/AS:341579052142593@1458450200317/A-functional-model-of-the-Vector-Processing-Unit-VPU-Data-stored-in-the-local-memory.png)

	In computing, a vector processor or array processor is a central processing unit (CPU) that implements an instruction set containing instructions that operate on one-dimensional arrays of data called vectors, compared to the scalar processors, whose instructions operate on single data items. Vector processors can greatly improve performance on certain workloads, notably numerical simulation and similar tasks. Vector machines appeared in the early 1970s and dominated supercomputer design through the 1970s into the 1990s, notably the various Cray platforms. The rapid fall in the price-to-performance ratio of conventional microprocessor designs led to the vector supercomputer's demise in the later 1990s.

## W

	![wpu](https://pic4.zhimg.com/80/v2-0c14ec2cf24e77555649d818dbc0dffb_hd.jpg)

	In 2014, an Indian company, Ineda Systems, advertised their WPU concept for the IOT market and received funding from Qualcomm and Samsung. The "Dhanush WPU" developed by Ineda Systems is divided into four levels to accommodate the computing needs of wearable devices from the average to the high-end, allowing the wearable device's battery to last up to 30 days of continuous battery life. Consumption. However, everything seems to have come to an abrupt end in 2015 and there is no news. Only at the bottom of the homepage has text display, Ineda applied for a registered trademark by WPU. The information about the WPU is only approximate, oh, yes, there is a US patent.
